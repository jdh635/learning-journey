# Learning Journey ☁️🚀☁️

Welcome to my learning journey! This repository is a log of the technical skills and knowledge I am developing, starting with AWS and expanding into other systems. Here, I will document my progress, completed labs, and challenges I encounter as I build my way toward mastering cloud architecture.

## 📖 About This Repository

This repository is structured to keep track of the labs and exercises I complete during my learning process. The goal is to:
- Organize my work and track progress.
- Document what I’ve learned in a clear and reusable way.
- Showcase my problem-solving and technical abilities.

### Current Focus:
- **AWS Solutions Architect Associate** - Logging labs and exercises as I prepare for the certification. This journey culminates in a **capstone project**, where I will design and build a **multi-tier architecture on AWS** that integrates everything I’ve learned.

### Future Topics:
- Exploring other cloud platforms, starting with Akamai.
- Diving into systems design and architecture.
- Mastering DevOps tools and practices.

## 🌟 The Learning Journey: Building Toward the Capstone

This journey is designed as a series of increasingly challenging labs, each building on the knowledge gained from the previous one. Each lab introduces key AWS concepts, hands-on practice, and real-world scenarios.

At the end of this journey, I'll tackle the **Capstone Project**: **"Build a Multi-Tier Architecture on AWS"**. This project brings together all the foundational skills learned, showcasing my ability to design, implement, and optimize a full-fledged architecture on the AWS cloud platform.
