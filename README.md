# Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my learning journey! This repository is a log of the technical skills and knowledge I am developing, starting with AWS and expanding into other systems. I will document my progress, labs, and challenges here.

## 📖 About This Repository

This repository is structured to keep track of the labs and exercises I complete during my learning process. The goal is to:
- Organise my work and track progress.
- Document what I’ve learned in a clear and reusable way.
- Showcase my problem-solving and technical abilities.

### Current Focus:
- **AWS Solutions Architect Associate** - Logging labs and exercises as I prepare for the certification.

### Future Topics:
